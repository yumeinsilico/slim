I knew I fucked up. I didn't know this shit was possible. I wasn't the type to fail. 

*I'm a real yung nigga from the six throwin' bows*

Lil Yachty reminded me. Calm down, calm down. I waked faster than usual, under the rustic arch, through the tunnels of Barrows. Stopped at the field. The moonlight was cold. 

*I'm a real yung nigga from the six throwin' bows*

I lay down on the grass. Felt the tears coming. You are a little bitch. Self-pitying, disgusting, egotistic fraud. You know it's true. 

*I'm a real yung nigga from the six throwin' bows*

I was scared of someone walking by. The wind chilled me and the grass was wet but I didn't give a fuck. Fuck. I was mad. I didn't know this kind of anger was possible. Just pure frustration. 

*I'm a real yung nigga from the six throwin' bows*

I wanted to destroy something. I took my phone and threw it onto the ground. Stomped on it until the screen was a miserable pile of shards. Fuck Lil Yachty. Suddenly, I was embarassed. It was pathetic really, that I would break down over something like this. This shit is trivial. Deep down I know it is. Maybe this was just the breeze that blew over my house of cards.

I lay there for a while longer, staring the moon down. Then I walked home in silence, and wondered what the fuck to do.
